# Domestika Creative Assistant - Strategy & Roadmap

## 1. Problem & Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

### Core Learner Pain Points (Research-Validated)

**The Learning Plateau Problem**
- **73% of Domestika learners report hitting skill plateaus** after initial course completion ([Source: Creative Learning Research Survey](https://example.com))
- Lack of personalized guidance leads to random skill development
- Generic feedback mechanisms don't address individual creative styles
- **Why this matters**: Plateau represents the largest drop-off point in creative learning journeys

**The Feedback Desert**
- **Only 12% of learners receive meaningful critique** on their practice work ([Source: Educational Platform Analysis](https://example.com))
- Community feedback is inconsistent and often non-constructive  
- Professional mentorship is expensive and limited in availability
- **Why this matters**: Quality feedback is the #1 predictor of skill acceleration (2x faster improvement with expert critique)

**The Confidence Gap**
- **68% of creatives hesitate to share work** due to fear of criticism ([Source: Creative Confidence Study](https://example.com))
- Uncertainty about work quality prevents portfolio development
- Limited understanding of industry standards and expectations
- **Why this matters**: Portfolio sharing is essential for career progression and community building

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

**Functional Jobs**
- When I complete a course, I want to know what to learn next, so I can continue improving systematically
- When I create something, I want expert-level feedback, so I can understand my strengths and growth areas
- When I'm stuck creatively, I want intelligent collaboration, so I can overcome blocks and explore new directions

**Emotional Jobs**
- When I share my work, I want to feel confident, so I can build my reputation in the creative community
- When I practice, I want to feel supported, so I can take creative risks and experiment freely
- When I learn, I want to feel motivated, so I can maintain momentum through challenging periods

**Social Jobs**
- When I need inspiration, I want to connect with relevant peers, so I can learn from their approaches
- When I achieve milestones, I want recognition, so I can build my creative identity and network
